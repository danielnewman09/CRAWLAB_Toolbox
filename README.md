# CRAWLAB Toolbox
This repository contains a package which facilitates research for the CRAWLAB. Included here are the necessary input shaping, plotting, and utility functions to which can be easily imported and implemented into your projects. Currently, this package contains multiple modules:

```python
InputShaping
si_shaping
plotting
utilities
IC_InputShaping
```

Through the `plotting` methods, high quality, publication-ready 2D and 3D plots can easily be created. 

All custom parameters are contained within this package, therefore eliminating the need for a custom matplotlibrc file and allowing rapid data visualization using high-level functions. Currently, this package is only guaranteed to work on Mac OSX for Python 3.6 and above.

This package is available on the anaconda cloud and can be installed by the following command in a bash terminal:

```
conda install -c danielnewman09 crawlab_toolbox
```


Examples for the use of these methods can be found in the `Examples` folder. Some basic plots are shown below:
